# Cape Town Web GIS (Mini Project)

## Overview

This project is a mini Web GIS application developed as part of my ongoing self-directed learning in geospatial technologies and web-based GIS. The application is built using Leaflet.js and is centred on the Cape Town metropolitan area.

The purpose of the project is to translate core Geomatics and GIS concepts into a functional, interactive web mapping environment, while strengthening my coding and problem-solving skills.

## Features

* Interactive map centred on the Cape Town metro area
* Multiple basemaps (OpenStreetMap and satellite imagery)
* Vector data representation (points, buffers, and polygons)
* Layer control for toggling map content
* Live coordinate display
* Scale bar for distance awareness
* Click-to-identify functionality for spatial referencing

---

## Technologies Used

* **Leaflet.js** – Web mapping library
* **OpenStreetMap** – Basemap data
* **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Frontend structure and logic
* **Git & GitHub** – Version control and deployment
* **GitHub Pages** – Hosting the live Web GIS

---

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

* Web-based GIS workflows
* Spatial data visualisation and interaction
* Cartographic controls and map usability
* Applying geomatics theory in a coding environment
* Version control and project deployment

This project reflects my commitment to continuous learning and applying theory through practical implementation.
